# RiskProcess_BrownianMotion
## Authors: Julia Grzegorzewska, Wiktoria Fimińska
### Description
This is a report for "Symulacje komputerowe" course at Politechnika Wrocławska. It consists of two tasks. 

First task was aimed at matching the model of classic Risk Process to the given data and then simulate it. Another purpose was to estimate the ruin probability using Monte Carlo method. 

Second task was about to estimate the average exit time of Brownian Motion from given range depending on the starting point.
